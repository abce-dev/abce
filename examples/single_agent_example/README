ABCE example case: single-agent example
Author: K. Biegel

==============================================================================
                                INSTRUCTIONS
==============================================================================
Inside the 'single_agent_example/' directory, run the following command:

$> python ../../run.py -f --settings_file=./settings.yml --inputs_path=.

An 'outputs/' directory will be created inside the current directory. This
  will contain the database output, an xlsx dump of the database, and some
  plots showing portfolio evolution over time.

==============================================================================
                                   OPTIONS
==============================================================================

------
CPLEX:
------
If you have CPLEX installed, change the `simulation: solver` setting in 
  `settings.yml` to CPLEX. This will speed up execution considerably.

-------
A-LEAF:
-------
If you have A-LEAF installed, change the `simulation: annual_dispatch_engine`
  setting in `settings.yml` to ALEAF.

----------
Verbosity:
----------
If you would like to see more detailed output, add the argument --verbosity=3
  to the run command above.
This option is recommended if you are not using CPLEX as your solver, as 
  execution will be very slow and you may like to see more frequent output.
